# osx-mojave-subpixel-enable
Appleâ€™s macOS Mojave disables subpixel antialiasing, also known as font smoothing, by default. On a MacBook Air or a desktop Mac hooked up to a non-Retina display, upgrading will make your fonts look worse.

``` shell
defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO
```

While subpixel font smoothing is disabled by default, you can re-enable it with a terminal command. There are four possible settings: 0 (disabled), 1 (light smoothing), 2 (medium smoothing), and 3 (heavy smoothing).

``` shell
defaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int {0,1,2,3}
```
